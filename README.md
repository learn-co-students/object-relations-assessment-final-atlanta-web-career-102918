# Module 1 Round 2: Flatflix

For this challenge, we'll be building out a Netflix clone!

A `Viewer` has many `Movie`s through `Review`s. A `Movie` can be reviewed by many `Viewer`s. A `Viewer` can review many `Movie`s, marking their rating on the `Review`.

As always, make sure to sketch out your domain and think about the single source of truth for your data.

## Key Concepts

- Class and instance variables
- Class and instance methods
- One-to-many relationships
- Many-to-many relationships
- Enumerables

## Getting Started

To get started, run `bundle install` while inside of this directory.

We've provided you with a console that you can use to test your code. To enter a console session, run `ruby tools/console.rb`.

You'll be able to test out the methods that you write here. Take a look at `tools/console.rb` to see where you can define variables and create object instances to test out your code, rather than manually doing it in every single console session.

## Deliverables

Your goal is to build out the sets of methods in order. _Each set of methods is built up from the last set of methods._

Do your best to follow Ruby best practices. For example, use higher-level array methods such as `map`, `select`, and `find` when appropriate in place of `each`.

### 1. `Review` model and relationships

- `Review#initialize`
- `Review.all`
  - returns an array of all initialized `Review` instances
- `Review#viewer`
  - returns the `Viewer` instance associated with the `Review` instance
- `Review#movie`
  - returns the `Movie` instance associated with the `Review` instance
- `Review#rating`
  - returns the rating for the `Review` instance;
  - if the viewer has not yet rated the movie, this method should return `nil`.

### 2. `Viewer` relationships

- `Viewer#reviews`
  - returns an array of `Review` instances associated with the `Viewer` instance.
- `Viewer#add_review`
  - receives a `Movie` instance as its only argument and adds it to the `Viewer` instance's list of reviewed movies;
  - returns a `Review` instance.
- `Viewer#reviewed_movies`
  - returns an array of `Movie` instances reviewed by the `Viewer` instance.
- `Viewer#rated_movie?`
  - receives a `Movie` instance as its only argument;
  - returns `true` if the `Viewer` instance already has an association with the `Movie` instance.

### 3. Checkpoint

After testing all of your code up to this point, `git add` and `git commit` your code. **No need to `git push` yet**.

### 4. `Movie` relationships

- `Movie#reviews`
  - returns an array of all the `Review` instances for the `Movie`.
- `Movie#viewers`
  - returns an array of all of the `Viewer` instances that reviewed the `Movie`.

### 5. Advanced `Review` methods

- `Movie#average_rating`
  - returns the average of all ratings for the `Movie` instance;
  - to average ratings, add all ratings together and divide by the total number of ratings.
- `Movie.highest_rated`
  - returns the `Movie` instance with the highest average rating.
- `Viewer#rate_movie`
  - receives a `Movie` instance and a rating as arguments;
  - assigns the rating to the `Review` instance already associated with this `Viewer` instance and the passed `Movie` instance;
  - if the `Viewer` instance and the passed `Movie` instance are _not_ already associated, this method should create a new `Review` instance;
  - rating should be a number between 1 and 5, other values should not be allowed.

## Wrapping up

When you have finished the deliverables or the time limit has been reached, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to your fork of the code challenge repo.

Visit your fork on GitHub, and make sure your changes are there. If your changes are there, click **New Pull Request**, provide a title, and click the green **Create Pull Request** button.

Copy the link of your pull request, paste it into the assignment page, and submit the assignment.
